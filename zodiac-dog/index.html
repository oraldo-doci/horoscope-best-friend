        <ol>
            <li>♈ <h2> (Ram): March 21–April 19</h2>
            </li>
            <button onclick="myFunction()">Discover</button>
            <div id="card-shepard">
                <img width="100%" src="./public/Dog-german-shepherd.jpg" alt="german-shepard"></img>
                <p>Natural born leaders like those born under the Aries sign deserve a dog who’s just as intelligent,
                    fearless, and full of energy as they are.
                    German Shepherds are often used as police dogs thanks to their loyalty and bravery. This energetic,
                    highly trainable breed is ideal for a fire sign like Aries.</p>
            </div>
            <li>♉ <h2>Taurus (Bull): April 20–May 20</h2>
            </li>
            <button onclick="myFunctionG()">Discover</button>
            <div id="card-golden">
                <img width="100%" src="./public/Golden-retriever.jpg" alt="Golden-retriever"></img>
                <p>Any Taurus appreciates the beauty in life and will naturally gravitate toward the prettiest breeds.
                    With his beautiful blonde coat and fetching doggy features, a golden retriever is an ideal pup to
                    fit into a Taurus’ picture-perfect lifestyle.
                    It doesn’t hurt that goldens are also loyal, dependable, and sociable — just like a Taurus.</p>
            </div>
            <li>♊ <h2> (Twins): May 21–June 21</h2>
            </li>
            <button onclick="myFunctionW()">Discover</button>
            <div id="card-welsh-corgi">
                <img width="100%" src="./public/Welsh-Corgi.jpg" alt="Welsh corgi"></img>
                <p>It should go without saying that the sign of the Twins will need to get two of whichever breed they
                    choose, which is why small-statured corgis make such an excellent option. Like their Gemini owners,
                    corgis are affectionate, smart, and sociable, plus they adore being the center of attention.
                    It’s a twin match made in heaven.</p>
            </div>
            <li>♋ <h2> Cancer (Crab): June 22–July 22</h2>
            </li>
            <button onclick="myFunctionP()">Discover</button>
            <div id="card-pomeranian">
                <img width="100%" src="./public/A-pretty-pomeranian-female.jpg" alt="A-pretty-pomeranian-female"></img>
                <p>Cancers tend to become insecure if they’re not constantly cuddled, kissed, and told how special they
                    are. Pomeranians understand that need and would love nothing more than to be included in the
                    lovefest. They don’t need a lot of exercise, which is perfect for their homebody Cancer owners who
                    would rather curl up in the house and relax.</p>
            </div>
            <li>♌ <h2> Leo (Lion): July 23–August 22</h2>
            </li>
            <button onclick="myFunctionR()">Discover</button>
            <div id="card-rottweiler">
                <img width="100%" src="./public/Rottweiler.jpg" alt="Rottweiler"></img>
                <p>Confident, courageous, and playful, Rottweilers have a lot in common with Leos. Both pet and owner
                    are natural born leaders who love being loved and showing affection. Well-trained Rotties are
                    fiercely loyal and protective toward their families, but they’re also just big, sweet lap dogs at
                    heart.</p>
            </div>
            <li>♍ <h2> Virgo (Virgin): August 23–September 22</h2>
            </li>
            <button onclick="myFunctionCh()">Discover</button>
            <div id="card-chow-cow">
                <img width="100%" src="./public/chow-chow-puppy.jpg" alt="chow-chow"></img>
                <p>Virgos are cool, calm, and calculated, and they don’t mind spending a lot of time alone. An energetic
                    or needy breed wouldn’t be a good fit — but a refined, slightly aloof Chow Chow is just right. Chow
                    Chows are reserved with strangers and loving toward family members, which a Virgo can certainly
                    relate to.</p>
            </div>
            <li>♎ <h2>Libra (Balance): September 23–October 23</h2>
            </li>
            <button onclick="myFunctionGr()">Discover</button>
            <div id="card-greyhound">
                <img width="100%" src="./public/Greyhound-Canis-familiaris-adult-standing.jpg"
                    alt="Greyhound-dog"></img>
                <p>Order, balance, harmony, and peace are all guiding principles for a Libra. They’re also likely to run
                    marathons, making them the ideal companion for a swift and agile greyhound. A greyhound’s stature
                    and personality will both appeal to the Libra owner.</p>
            </div>
            <li>♏<h2> Scorpius (Scorpion): October 24–November 21</h2>
            </li>
            <button onclick="myFunctionTr()">Discover</button>
            <div id="card-terrier">
                <img width="100%" src="./public/norfolk-terrier.jpg" alt="terrier-dog"></img>
                <p>A Scorpio is known for being slightly feisty and unafraid to try new things. Looking for a canine
                    friend who can keep up? Check out the small yet mighty Norfolk terrier, who is equally fearless and
                    fun-loving. They’ll be up for any kind of adventure and have a good attitude while doing it.</p>
            </div>
            <li>♐ <h2>Sagittarius (Archer): November 22–December 21</h2>
            </li>
            <button onclick="myFunctionAs()">Discover</button>
            <div id="card-australian">
                <img width="100%" src="./public/Australian-shepard.jpg" alt="australian-shepard-dog"></img>
                <p>Forget boring routines — a Sagittarius wants to travel and discover new things, so they’ll need a
                    breed who wants to explore the world together. Sagittarians also value intelligence, making them a
                    perfect match for the smart and wily Australian shepherd. Closely associated with ranches and
                    cowboys, they’ll be up for any kind of rodeo.</p>
            </div>
            <li>♑ <h2>Capricornus (Goat): December 22–January 19</h2>
            </li>
            <button onclick="myFunctionSb()">Discover</button>
            <div id="card-St-Benard">
                <img width="100%" src="./public/St.-Bernard-Dog.jpg" alt="St.Benard-dog"></img>
                <p>A driven, meticulous Capricorn deserves an equally tireless companion who recognizes the value of a
                    hard day’s work. The St. Bernard is one of the world’s most famous and beloved breeds for good
                    reason. He’s playful, charming, inquisitive, and one of the hardest working dogs you can choose.</p>
            </div>
            <li>♒<h2> Aquarius (Water Bearer): January 20–February 18</h2>
            </li>
            <button onclick="myFunctionCa()">Discover</button>
            <div id="card-Cavalier-King-Charles-spaniel">
                <img width="100%" src="./public/Cavalier-King-Charles-Spaniel.jpg"
                    alt="Cavalier-King-Charles-spaniel-dog"></img>
                <p>At the end of the day, don’t you want a dog who’s just like you? A cavalier King Charles is small in
                    stature and big in personality. Like any true Aquarius, he’s endlessly adaptable plus affectionate,
                    graceful, and gentle. They’re also happy to interact with strangers and tend to give people the
                    benefit of the doubt — true Aquarian traits.</p>
            </div>
            <li>♓ <h2>Pisces (Fish): February 19–March 20</h2>
            </li>
            <button onclick="myFunctionPo()">Discover</button>
            <div id="card-poodle">
                <img width="100%" src="./public/White-poodle-dog.jpg" alt="Poodle-dog"></img>
                <p>A Pisces person is one of the most introspective and creative signs in the zodiac. They’re often
                    misunderstood, just like their ideal companion dog, the poodle. Poodles are highly intelligent and
                    trainable. While some may see them as prissy, in reality they have a lot to offer beneath those
                    fluffy coats.</p>
